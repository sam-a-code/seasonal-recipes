# Farmers Marker Recipe Finder

This project was the first project I created as part of my full stack software engineering bootcamp, working with two other team members to build this resource. The goal of this project is to help people find recipes inspired by produce that is available in their farmers markets.

We also used an API to suggest recipes once users have selected a produce item! We did hide the API key so please reach out if you'd like access to it!


## Using my site

In the project directory, you can run:

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

When you make changes the page will reload automatically. You may also see lint errors in the console.

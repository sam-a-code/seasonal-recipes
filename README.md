# ðŸ¥¦ Farmers Marker Recipe Finder

This project was the first project I created as part of my full stack software engineering bootcamp, working with two other team members to build this resource. The goal of this project is to help people find recipes inspired by produce that is seasonally and locally available.

We also used an API to suggest recipes once users have selected a produce item. We did hide the API key so please reach out if you'd like access to it!


## ðŸ§„ Using the recipe finder

To get started, run the following command:
#### `open index.html`

Once in the recipe finder, click a season to view the available produce items. Click a produce item name and it will fill the search bar. You can also write an item name directly in the search bar. Click "Find recipes" to view suggested recipes.
